  "readme": "# emojipacks\n\n> CLI to bulk upload emojis to your Slack!\n\n## Install\n\n*Note you must have `node` and `npm` installed. If you don't, go to [nodejs.org](https://www.nodejs.org) and follow the install instructions there.*\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g emojipacks\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:lambtron/emojipacks.git\n$ cd emojipacks\n$ make\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThere is only one command:\n\n```bash\n$ emojipacks\n```\n\nIt'll ask you a few questions:\n\n```bash\nSlack subdomain: 20percentclub\nEmail address login: andyjiang@gmail.com\nPassword: *********\nPath or URL of Emoji yaml file: ./packs/futurama.yaml\n```\n\nThen, let it work its magic:\n\n```bash\nStarting import\nGot tokens\nLogged in\nUpload crumb is s-1437797544-90b75206a7-â˜ƒ\nGetting emoji page\nUploading bender with http://i.imgur.com/7zYM751.png\nUploading amywong with http://i.imgur.com/DgKkcCi.png\n .\n .\n .\nUploading hypnotoad with http://i.imgur.com/o7tyjxN.gif\nUploaded emojis\n```\n\nNote that the emoji pack to upload can be a **path** to a yaml file on your machine or a **URL**, like [http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/food.yaml](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/food.yaml).\n\n## Emoji Yaml File\n\nAlso note that the yaml file must be indented properly and formatted as such:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: food\nemojis:\n  - name: apple\n    src: http://i.imgur.com/Rw0Vlda.png\n  - name: applepie\n    src: http://i.imgur.com/g4RU1fM.png\n```\n\n..with the `src` pointing to an image file. According to Slack:\n\n- Square images work best\n- Image can't be larger than 128px in width or height\n- Image must be smaller than 64K in file size\n\n\n## Emoji packs\n\n- [futurama](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/futurama.yaml)\n- [food](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/food.yaml)\n- [skype](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/skype.yaml)\n- [starwars](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/starwars.yaml)\n- [startups](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/startups.yaml)\n- [businessfish](http://www.emojipacks.com/packs/businessfish.yaml)\n- [hipchat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambtron/emojipacks/master/packs/hipchat.yaml)\n- [twitch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambtron/emojipacks/master/packs/twitch.yaml)\n- [Slackmojis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambtron/emojipacks/master/packs/slackmojis.yaml)\n- [parrotparty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambtron/emojipacks/master/packs/parrotparty.yaml) ([Parrot](http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/) [Paint](http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/paint/))\n\n![](http://media1.giphy.com/media/68H7QjnqFOn2E/100.gif)\n\nWant to contribute? [Suggest an emoji pack](https://20p.typeform.com/to/xOFDyq)!\n\n## Batch use\n\nYou can set the following environment variables instead of being prompted interactively for the parameters:\n\n* `SLACK_SUBDOMAIN`\n* `SLACK_EMAIL`\n* `SLACK_PASSWORD`\n* `SLACK_EMOJIPACK`\n\nFor example:\n\n    SLACK_SUBDOMAIN=example SLACK_EMAIL=foobar@example.com SLACK_PASSWORD='secret-pw' SLACK_EMOJIPACK=packs/futurama.pack bin/emojipacks\n\nThis is convenient when you want to import many emoji packs at once, you might use this to import ![:allthethings:](https://dujrsrsgsd3nh.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/allthethings-1414024836@2x.png) at once for example:\n\n    export SLACK_SUBDOMAIN=example SLACK_EMAIL=foobar@example.com SLACK_PASSWORD='secret-pw'\n    for emoji in packs/*.yaml; do  SLACK_EMOJIPACK=\"$emoji\" bin/emojipacks; done\n\nPlease be cautious and know that if you use the environment variable configurations to drive the import on a multiuser system, that other people logged in could observe your Slack domain, email, and password while the script is running, as environment variables are not private. This does not matter so much on a single user system, such as your personal computer.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis script will essentially log into your Slack and then submit a `POST` request on the emoji upload form page. If you are seeing errors, make sure that:\n- **you have Slack privileges to add custom emojis**: otherwise, the script won't be able to get to the emoji upload form\n- **you disabled two-factor authentication**: again, having two-factor enabled will prevent the script from getting to the necessary emoji upload form\n- **your credentials are correct**: if you have done all of the following correctly try running the command **emojipacks -d**\n\n*Still having issues?
